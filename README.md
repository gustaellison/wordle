## Objective:
Guess the hidden word within a limited number of attempts.

Each guess must be a five-letter word and players have 5 attempts.The game ends when the players correctly guess the word or exhaust their allowed attempts.

Words that are not five letters long are not valid guesses.

- Yellow: Correct letter but in the wrong position.
- Gray/Black: Incorrect letter.

## Example

Let's say the secret word is "PLATE." If a player guesses "PLUMB," the feedback might be:
- Green for the 'P' in the correct position.
- Yellow for the 'L' in the wrong position.
- Gray/Black for the other letters not in the word.
